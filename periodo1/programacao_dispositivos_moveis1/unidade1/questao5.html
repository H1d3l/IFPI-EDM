    <h1>Outward</h1>
    <p>
        Outward is an open-world fantasy RPG developed by Canadian studio Nine Dots Studio, which was released on March
        26, 2019. The game can be played in co-operative multiplayer both online and locally (through splitscreen). The
        game focuses on exploration as well as the concept of the player being a commoner rather than a hero, and
        features several survival game aspects.

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <blockquote cite="https://outward.fandom.com/wiki/Outward#New_Player_Guide">
        The game starts with the player character, an inhabitant of the city of Cierzo, getting shipwrecked off the
        coast of their home city. They had previously inherited a debt called a Blood Price from their ancestors, a debt
        that must be periodically paid. A Blood Price affects all members of a given family, and the voyage was meant to
        pay it off. Now penniless, and despite having barely survived the deadly wreck, they are given only five days by
        the desperate townsfolk to pay off this debt and retain the family holdings.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote cite="https://outward.fandom.com/wiki/Outward#New_Player_Guide">Once this debt has been paid, or the players home has been seized, the player is given multiple ways to react to
        their unfair situation and the true story begins. They can free themselves of their bloodline by joining the
        Holy Mission of Elatt, enter a new spotless bloodline by helping the Blue Chamber Collective, or free themselves
        of the entire system through the Heroic Kingdom of Levant. These three factions are trapped in a stalemate; the
        Blue Chamber wants to uphold the current status quo, the Kingdom of Levant wants to overthrow the unfair Blood
        Price system and let people live for themselves, and the Holy Mission similarly rejects the bloodline and social
        systems upheld by the Blue Chamber but only because it hinders the forming of a unified front against the common
        enemy of mankind, an otherworldly force called the Scourge.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote cite="https://outward.fandom.com/wiki/Outward#New_Player_Guide">After the player joins a faction, the stalemate starts to crack and global events begin to progress. The main
        part of the story consists of parallel storylines, one for each of these factions, all of which are perspectives
        of the bigger story. Main quests have time limits, though these are typically at least one month.
